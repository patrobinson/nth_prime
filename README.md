# Nth Prime

Since I first started learning to code I have started by creating a prime number generator in each new language I learnt.

Without understanding the mathematical theory behind prime number generation I ended up re-inventing a ["sub-optimal trial division sieve"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes#Incremental_sieve).

As I'm now learning to write TLA+ proofs, I figured it'd make sense to write a proof for my terrible algorithm I wrote first when I was 18.
